# ðŸš€ Final Stage â€” Deployment, Testing, CI/CD & Ops for **Snapp** Ecosystem

This document describes how to **package, test, deploy, and operate** the entire Snapp ecosystem (snapp, map, food, bank, email and supporting microservices). It gives a _simple development path_ (quick local deploy) and a _production-grade path_ (Kubernetes, CI/CD, observability), plus testing strategy, API documentation requirements, inter-service communication options, and optional professional features.

> Keep the rule: each microservice is an independently buildable repository under the `snapp-map` GitHub org. Every repo must include: `Dockerfile`, automated tests, OpenAPI (or proto) spec, README, and a `deploy/` folder with compose + k8s manifests / Helm chart.

----------

# 1 â€” Simple, fast deploy (developer-friendly)

Provide an easy path so students can run the whole system locally.

**Recommend:**

-   Per-service `Dockerfile`.
    
-   A top-level `docker-compose.yml` (in each hub repo or a separate `infra/` repo) that composes all required services for local dev: snapp services, map (or map-mock), food services, bank, email, auth mock, database containers, message broker (RabbitMQ/Redis), and an API gateway (optional).
    

**`docker-compose.yml` (skeleton)**  
(Place in `snapp-map/stack/docker-compose.yml`)

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment: [ POSTGRES_USER=snapp, POSTGRES_PASSWORD=snapp, POSTGRES_DB=snapp ]
    volumes: ["./data/db:/var/lib/postgresql/data"]

  redis:
    image: redis:7
    ports: ["6379:6379"]

  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3-management
    ports: ["5672:5672","15672:15672"]

  map-service:
    build: ../../map-hub/map-service
    environment: [ DATABASE_URL=postgres://... ]
    depends_on: ["postgres","redis"]

  snapp-user-service:
    build: ../../snapp-hub/user-service
    environment: [ DATABASE_URL=postgres://... ]
    depends_on: ["postgres"]

  # ... other services

```

**How to run:** `docker-compose up --build` â€” a single command to bring up the dev environment.

----------

# 2 â€” Production deploy (recommended): Kubernetes + Helm

For production-style deployment use **Kubernetes**. Provide:

-   A Helm chart per microservice (or one umbrella chart for the whole hub).
    
-   Namespaces: `snapp-dev`, `snapp-staging`, `snapp-prod`.
    
-   Ingress Controller (NGINX) or API Gateway (Kong/Traefik).
    
-   Use `Deployment`, `Service`, `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`.
    

**Kubernetes best-practices**

-   Use images pushed to a registry (GitHub Packages / Docker Hub / private registry).
    
-   Keep secrets out of Git (use Kubernetes Secrets, sealed-secrets, or HashiCorp Vault).
    
-   Use resource requests/limits.
    
-   Use liveness & readiness probes.
    
-   Use rolling updates, or for safer upgrades, canary/blue-green via tooling (Argo Rollouts or service mesh).
    

**Minimal `deployment.yaml` snippet**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: { name: map-service }
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector: { matchLabels: { app: map-service } }
  template:
    metadata: { labels: { app: map-service } }
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: map
        image: ghcr.io/snapp-map/map-service:0.1.0
        envFrom: 
        - secretRef: { name: map-secrets }
        ports: [{ containerPort: 8000 }]
        livenessProbe: ...
        readinessProbe: ...

```

----------

# 3 â€” CI / CD (example: GitHub Actions)

Create a standard pipeline for every microservice repository. Each pipeline should:

1.  Run lint & static analysis.
    
2.  Run unit tests -> collect coverage.
    
3.  Build Docker image and run integration tests (optional).
    
4.  Push image to registry (on success, on tag).
    
5.  Deploy to staging (on merge to `main`) and optional prod on tag/approval.
    

**Example GitHub Actions (pseudo)**

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node / Java / Python / Go (per repo)
      - run: ./gradlew test # or npm test / pytest / go test
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: coverage report
  build-and-push:
    needs: build-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/snapp-map/${{ github.repo }}:${{ github.sha }}
  deploy-staging:
    needs: build-and-push
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
      - run: helm upgrade --install map-service ./deploy/helm --namespace snapp-staging

```

**Notes**

-   Use branch protection & required checks.
    
-   Use secrets for registry and kubeconfig.
    
-   Require manual approval for production deploys.
    

----------

# 4 â€” Testing Strategy (what to write & tools)

Testing must be part of grading. Recommend these layers:

1.  **Unit Tests** â€” fast, isolated. (JUnit for Java, Jest/Mocha for Node, pytest for Python, `testing` for Go.)
    
    -   Cover business logic (price calc, matching algorithms).
        
2.  **Integration Tests** â€” service with DB and message broker (use testcontainers / docker-compose).
    
    -   Verify persistence, external API interactions (map-bank-email mocks).
        
3.  **Contract Tests** â€” consumer-driven contracts (Pact) or verify OpenAPI/gRPC protobuf compatibility.
    
    -   Important for polyglot teams.
        
4.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests** â€” run against a deployed staging stack.
    
    -   Cypress / Playwright for UI (if any), Postman/Newman or REST clients for APIs.
        
5.  **Smoke Tests** â€” quick health checks after deploy.
    
6.  **Performance Tests** â€” k6 or Gatling for load testing critical flows (e.g., dispatch matching).
    
7.  **Security & Static Analysis**
    
    -   SAST (Bandit for Python, SonarQube), dependency scanning (Dependabot, Snyk), container scanning (Trivy).
        
8.  **Chaos / Resilience Tests** (optional) â€” test service degradation.
    

**Grading hooks**

-   Each repo must run `make test` and produce an artifacts folder with test coverage and a junit-style report to be collected by CI.
    

----------

# 5 â€” API Documentation & Developer Experience

Documentation is required and part of the deliverable.

**Musts:**

-   **OpenAPI (Swagger)** for REST services (auto-generated). Publish `swagger.json` in repo and a hosted Swagger UI (or at `/docs`).
    
-   For gRPC services ship `.proto` files and auto-generated client stubs.
    
-   README with:
    
    -   Purpose, quick start, endpoints, environment variables, DB migrations, how to run tests, and how to build images.
        
-   **Architecture docs**: system overview, sequence diagrams for important flows (booking, payment), service contracts.
    
-   **ADR (Architecture Decision Records)**: record big decisions (why REST vs gRPC, choice of broker).
    
-   **CHANGELOG.md** and semantic versioning for each microservice.
    

----------

# 6 â€” Inter-service Communication Patterns

Multiple options â€” choose based on use-case.

1.  **Synchronous HTTP REST (OpenAPI)**
    
    -   Easy, human-readable, great for request/response (auth, user profile).
        
2.  **gRPC**
    
    -   Good for high-throughput, low-latency RPC between polyglot services; strongly typed structs via proto files. Recommend for internal service-to-service core contracts (map â†’ snapp).
        
3.  **Message Broker (async)** â€” RabbitMQ / Kafka / NATS
    
    -   Use for events: `ride_requested`, `driver_accepted`, `payment_completed`. Promotes resiliency and decoupling.
        
4.  **Webhooks**
    
    -   Useful for pushing events to external systems (or 3rd-party callbacks).
        
5.  **SDK / Client Libraries** (recommended)
    
    -   Provide language-specific clients (a tiny `snapp-client-js`, `snapp-client-go`) encapsulating auth, retries, backoff, and common DTOs. Easier for students than calling raw HTTP every time.
        
6.  **API Gateway** (Kong/Tyk/Traefik) or Adapters
    
    -   Centralizes authentication, rate-limiting, request routing, and can host API docs.
        

**Recommendation:** Use **REST + Events** as default. Provide **client SDKs** (small libraries with typed request/response and retries) to simplify integration.

----------

# 7 â€” Observability & Logging

Production-level observability helps debugging and grading.

-   **Structured logs** (JSON) with fields: `timestamp`, `service`, `trace_id`, `level`, `message`.
    
-   Centralized logging: **EFK/ELK** (Elasticsearch + Fluentd/Logstash + Kibana) or Loki + Grafana.
    
-   **Metrics**: expose Prometheus metrics (`/metrics`) and collect with Prometheus. Key metrics: request latency, error rates, queue lengths, job processing times.
    
-   **Tracing**: Distributed tracing with **Jaeger** or **Zipkin** â€” add trace IDs to logs and propagate across services.
    
-   **Dashboards**: Grafana dashboards for latency, errors, throughput, and resource usage.
    

----------

# 8 â€” Security & Secrets

-   Use TLS for all external endpoints; for dev you may allow HTTP.
    
-   Store secrets in Kubernetes secrets / Vault. Never commit them.
    
-   Use OAuth2/JWT for service-to-service auth or mTLS (service mesh).
    
-   Enforce role-based access control for APIs (admin/support/driver/user scopes).
    
-   Use Dependency scanning, SCA, and SAST in CI.
    

----------

# 9 â€” Data & Backups

-   Each microservice can have its own DB schema (per-service DB).
    
-   Use logical backups for Postgres (pg_dump), and automate snapshots.
    
-   For stateful data like message queues, use durable persistence or retention policies.
    

----------

# 10 â€” Release strategies

-   **Rolling updates** by default.
    
-   Support **canary** or **blue/green** (Argo Rollouts / Flagger) for safer releases.
    
-   Keep versioned APIs; support backward compatibility for a release cycle.
    

----------

# 11 â€” Optional professional features (extra credit)

These are _not required_ but great for students to explore:

-   **Service Mesh** (Istio/Linkerd) for mTLS, traffic shaping, observability.
    
-   **Advanced Monitoring**: anomaly detection, alerting (PagerDuty, Opsgenie).
    
-   **Central Policy**: OPA (Open Policy Agent) for authorization rules.
    
-   **Advanced Logging**: structured correlation across requests, log enrichment.
    
-   **Autoscaling & Cost Optimization**: HPA + cluster autoscaler.
    
-   **AI features**:
    
    -   Demand forecasting (when to increase driver incentives).
        
    -   Route optimizations learned from telemetry.
        
    -   Smart ETA predictions using ML models.
        
    -   Chatbot for support (NLP).
        
-   **Analytics Warehouse**: dump events into a data lake (ClickHouse/BigQuery) for analytics dashboards.
    
-   **Monitoring Uptime & SLAs**: SLOs, error budget reporting.
    
-   **CI/CD elaboration**: Canary deploy automation and auto-rollbacks on health checks.
    

----------

# 12 â€” Grading checklist for final submission

For each team/repo, require the following deliverables:

-   âœ… `README.md` with quick-start & architecture overview
    
-   âœ… `Dockerfile` + functional `docker-compose.yml` to run locally
    
-   âœ… Helm chart or `k8s/` manifests for deployment
    
-   âœ… Unit & Integration tests with reports and coverage badge
    
-   âœ… GitHub Actions (or equivalent) pipeline file(s) that run tests and build images
    
-   âœ… OpenAPI spec (`openapi.yaml`) or `.proto` files and generated client stubs
    
-   âœ… Example `client` usage snippet (curl + sample SDK usage)
    
-   âœ… Logging format sample and `/metrics` endpoint
    
-   âœ… Postman collection or automated E2E test script
    
-   âœ… Optional: Prometheus + Grafana dashboard export for 2â€“3 key charts (latency, errors, throughput)
    

Grade weight ideas:

-   Phase 1 MVP correctness & stability â€” 40%
    
-   Tests & CI/CD â€” 20%
    
-   Documentation & API contracts â€” 15%
    
-   Deployment scripts (compose + k8s/helm) â€” 10%
    
-   Observability & extras â€” 10%
    
-   Design principles & code quality (SOLID, patterns) â€” 5%
    

----------

# 13 â€” Practical tips to keep it simple

-   Start with **docker-compose** for everything. Only graduate to Kubernetes when the MVP works.
    
-   Use lightweight message broker (Redis Streams or RabbitMQ) instead of full Kafka unless needed.
    
-   Provide pre-built mock services (map-mock, auth-mock) so teams can run core features without waiting for other teams.
    
-   Encourage **client libraries** for common contract use â€” faster integration and fewer mistakes.

# 14 â€” Example repository layout (per microservice)

```bash
user-service/
 â”œâ”€ src/
 â”œâ”€ tests/
 â”œâ”€ Dockerfile
 â”œâ”€ openapi.yaml
 â”œâ”€ README.md
 â”œâ”€ deploy/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€ docker-compose.yml
 â”‚   â”œâ”€ helm/
 â”‚   â””â”€ k8s/
 â”œâ”€ .github/workflows/ci.yml
 â””â”€ Makefile # make build/test/run
```
----------

If youâ€™d like, I can:

-   Produce a **sample GitHub Actions CI file** tuned for one of the languages (e.g., Spring Boot or FastAPI).
    
-   Generate a **starter `docker-compose.yml`** that includes the minimal set of services (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, auth-mock, map-mock, snapp-user, snapp-trip).
    
-   Create a **grading rubric** in checklist form for students.
