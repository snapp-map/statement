# üåê Language & Framework Recommendations (per hub / service)

Because your students know **Java/Spring Boot, Node.js, Django, Flask, FastAPI, and Go**, we can assign services based on _strengths of each stack_. This also creates a realistic polyglot microservices environment.

----------

### 1. **Snapp (core ride-hailing hub)**

Handles **users, drivers, trips, dispatching, roles, payments integration**. Needs high reliability, strong typing, and scalability.

-   **Recommended:** **Java + Spring Boot**
    
-   **Why:**
    
    -   Mature ecosystem for enterprise-scale apps.
        
    -   Excellent support for complex domain logic (DDD, CQRS).
        
    -   Rich libraries for authentication, messaging, and REST.
        
    -   Strong static typing = fewer runtime surprises.
        
-   **Alternative:** **Go** for trip-matching & dispatch (lightweight, fast concurrency).
    

----------

### 2. **Map Service (routing, ETA, energy consumption)**

Handles geospatial algorithms, pathfinding, traffic modeling. Needs high-performance computation.

-   **Recommended:** **Go**
    
-   **Why:**
    
    -   Concurrency (goroutines) for handling many routing requests.
        
    -   Compiles to small, fast binaries (great for CPU-heavy workloads).
        
    -   Strong libraries for graph algorithms and math.
        
-   **Alternative:** **Python (FastAPI)** for prototyping if performance is not critical.
    

----------

### 3. **Food / Marketplace Hub**

Dynamic product categories (food, grocery, bread, medicine), location-based queries. Needs flexible APIs and fast iteration.

-   **Recommended:** **Python + FastAPI**
    
-   **Why:**
    
    -   Very fast to develop APIs.
        
    -   Async support for handling many requests (search, store updates).
        
    -   Pydantic makes schema validation simple.
        
    -   Easy extensibility for categories.
        
-   **Alternative:** **Node.js (Express/NestJS)** for teams comfortable with JS/TS.
    

----------

### 4. **Bank Service**

Core requirements: accounts, transactions, payment links, deposits. Needs security, ACID guarantees, strict validation.

-   **Recommended:** **Java + Spring Boot**
    
-   **Why:**
    
    -   Excellent database transaction support.
        
    -   Security frameworks (Spring Security).
        
    -   Battle-tested for banking-style apps.
        
-   **Alternative:** **Django** (Python) if team prefers ORM-driven approach.
    

----------

### 5. **Email Service**

Lightweight service to send/receive messages. Doesn‚Äôt need enterprise features.

-   **Recommended:** **Node.js (Express or NestJS)**
    
-   **Why:**
    
    -   Lightweight, simple for async I/O.
        
    -   Nodemailer makes SMTP/email sending easy.
        
    -   Scales well for handling thousands of small requests.
        
-   **Alternative:** **Flask** for minimal Python-based solution.
    

----------

### 6. **Support Chat / Messaging** (between driver & passenger, and with support)

-   **Recommended:** **Node.js + WebSockets (Socket.IO)**
    
-   **Why:**
    
    -   JS event-driven model is perfect for real-time messaging.
        
    -   Simple integration into web/mobile clients.
        

----------

# üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools & Methods

To keep students productive and aligned, recommend these practices:

----------

### 1. **Version Control & Collaboration**

-   Use **GitHub / GitLab** with:
    
    -   Branching model: `main` (stable), `dev`, feature branches (`feature/trip-matching`).
        
    -   Pull Requests with mandatory reviews.
        
    -   Issue tracking & Kanban board (GitHub Projects / Jira).
        
-   **Code ownership**: assign a primary team for each microservice, but allow cross-reviews.
    

----------

### 2. **API Contracts & Documentation**

-   Every service must provide **OpenAPI/Swagger spec** (or `.proto` for gRPC).
    
-   Maintain a **shared API repo** (`contracts/`) that all teams pull from.
    
-   Prevents integration headaches.
    

----------

### 3. **Local Development**

-   Provide a **top-level `docker-compose.yml`** to spin up all services with mock dependencies.
    
-   Use **hot reload** (Spring DevTools, Nodemon, FastAPI‚Äôs auto-reload) for speed.
    
-   Use **Postman** or **Insomnia** collections for testing APIs.
    

----------

### 4. **Databases**

-   Standardize on **PostgreSQL** for relational data.
    
-   Use **Redis** for caching and driver/passenger location tracking.
    
-   Each service owns its database schema (no shared DB).
    

----------

### 5. **Communication Between Services**

-   Prefer **REST + JSON** for simplicity.
    
-   Use **gRPC** for high-performance services (map, dispatch).
    
-   Use **message broker (RabbitMQ or Kafka)** for events like `trip_requested`, `payment_completed`.
    

----------

### 6. **Testing Strategy**

-   **Unit tests** in the service‚Äôs native framework (JUnit, pytest, Jest, Go test).
    
-   **Integration tests** with `testcontainers` or local docker-compose.
    
-   **Contract tests** (Pact) to validate service interfaces.
    
-   CI runs tests automatically on pull requests.
    

----------

### 7. **CI/CD**

-   GitHub Actions or GitLab CI:
    
    -   Lint ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Push Docker image ‚Üí Deploy (staging).
        
-   Deploy staging automatically; deploy to production requires approval.
    

----------

### 8. **Collaboration Methods**

-   Weekly standups (short status calls).
    
-   Each hub (snapp, map, food, bank, email) has its **own Slack/Discord channel**.
    
-   Shared **Notion/Confluence** page for architecture diagrams & design docs.
    
-   Use **ADR (Architecture Decision Records)** ‚Äî short markdown files recording big decisions.
    

----------

### 9. **Development Aids**

-   **Linters & formatters**: ESLint/Prettier, Black/Flake8, Golangci-lint, Checkstyle.
    
-   **Pre-commit hooks** with Husky or pre-commit.
    
-   **Container debugging**: use Tilt or Skaffold for live k8s dev (optional).
    

----------

### 10. **Division of Labor**

-   **Core Snapp hub**: Java/Spring Boot team.
    
-   **Map service**: Go team.
    
-   **Food hub**: Python/FastAPI team.
    
-   **Bank**: Java/Spring Boot team (or Django if needed).
    
-   **Email & messaging**: Node.js team.
    
-   **Support/Monitoring/CI**: Cross-team effort.
